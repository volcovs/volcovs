# 👋 Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile — where signal processing meets modern AI, and curiosity drives creation.

## 🧠 About Me
I'm in my last year of my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree and a developer exploring the intersection of **neuroscience and machine learning**. My current work focuses on applying **Transformer models to EEG brain signals**, extracting interpretable language representations directly from brain activity. I enjoy blending signal processing with deep learning, and I’m always up for building **interactive applications**.

🎓 **Thesis:** _Applying Transformer Models on Brain Signals to Learn Representations of Brain Language_  
🛠️ Keywords: EEG, Transformers, Explainable AI, Spectrograms, Saliency Maps

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Spring Boot, React
- **Tools**: Streamlit, WebSockets, Ontology Editors (Protégé), Docker
- **Other**: NLP, Signal Processing

## 🧠 Research Interests
- Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI)
- Neuro-AI interpretability

## 🎮 Fun Facts
- Big fan of **The Legend of Zelda**, **Minecraft** and **Stardew Valley**.
- Love building interactive demos (ask me about my **EEG spectrogram viewer** with saliency overlays in Streamlit!).
